This is a ruby program to enable automated testing of VT220 applications over telnet.

I don’t have a legacy VT220 application kicking around so I’m currently using the pico editor to develop this.

It’s currently in very early development, everything thats checked in seems to be working, however there are still a lot of vt220 commands not implemented yet. I’m going on holiday and will probably begin development in earnest around the end of August.

Getting Started
===============

Set up telnet
-------------
You will need to enable telnet on whatever computer you are trying to connect to.

On Ubuntu and probably all Debian like things you can do this by
sudo apt-get install telnetd

I’m very sure telnet isn’t considered secure these days so recommend using something like Uncomlicated fire wall to only allow local connections. I’ve also made a special account with almost no permission for testing this.

Running Beltone

Interactive Mode
----------------
From the root of the check out directory
ruby bin/beltone.rb

Unfortunately the name is incredibly misleading its not really all that interactive as yet. It will run pico for you then pretty much abandon you

Unit Tests
----------

spec spec
A complete ruby parsed VT220 screen will appear on the console in front of your very eyes!


Todo List
=========

* understand styling, add colour
* show where the cursor is
* allow interactive mode to really send commands
* make it work on windows as well as unix
* Make it a gem
* rcov
* add cursor rules (stop it going of edge of screen)
* set up a debug thing
* sort out config
